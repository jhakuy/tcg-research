# 🤖 Complete ML Workflow Guide

## 🚀 How the Pokemon Card ML System Works

Your ML system now has **real eBay + PSA data integration** with ultra-conservative decision making. Here's exactly how to run it:

---

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

### ✅ API Keys Setup
```bash
# Check your .env file has:
EBAY_APP_ID=your_ebay_app_id
EBAY_CERT_ID=your_ebay_cert_id  
PSA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_psa_token  # ✅ Already configured
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
```

### ✅ Dependencies
```bash
pip install catboost scikit-learn pandas numpy sqlalchemy
```

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Workflow

### **Option 1: Full Automated Pipeline (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run everything in one command
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode full

# This will:
# 1. Collect fresh eBay data (20 cards per target)
# 2. Generate ML features  
# 3. Train CatBoost models
# 4. Generate predictions
# 5. Run PSA-enhanced conservative analysis
# 6. Output BUY/WATCH/AVOID recommendations
```

### **Option 2: Step-by-Step Manual Control**

#### Step 1: Collect Real Market Data
```bash
# Collect fresh eBay listings for 10 high-value Pokemon cards
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode collect --days 7

# Targets automatically include:
# - Charizard Brilliant Stars Secret Rare
# - Pikachu Pokemon 151 Special Illustration  
# - Umbreon Evolving Skies Alt Art
# - Classic Base Set holos
# - And more liquid/valuable cards
```

#### Step 2: Generate ML Features
```bash
# Create features from collected data
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode features --days 30

# Generates 25+ features per card:
# - Price momentum (30/90/180 day)
# - Liquidity metrics (turnover, spread)
# - Market signals (listing trends)
# - PSA scarcity scores
```

#### Step 3: Train Models
```bash
# Train CatBoost models on real data
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode train --days 30

# Trains two models:
# - Regression: Predicts % return over 3 months
# - Classification: BUY/WATCH/AVOID categories
```

#### Step 4: Generate Predictions
```bash
# Create predictions for all cards
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode predict

# Uses trained models to predict:
# - Expected 3-month return %
# - Confidence level (0-100%)
# - Risk classification
```

#### Step 5: Conservative Analysis + PSA
```bash
# Run ultra-conservative decision engine with PSA data
python -m tcg_research.workflows.ml_pipeline --mode analyze --limit 10

# Only recommends BUY if:
# - 20%+ predicted return
# - 90%+ confidence
# - PSA scarcity score 70+
# - Gem rate <15% (hard to grade)
# - Strong liquidity + momentum
```
